# Connected Portal

*Connected* provides a *Web Interface* for **Creating** and **Managing** [Subscriptions](Subscription.md) called a *Connected Portal*. It's a centralized management infrastructure for [Public](PublicCloud.md) and [Private](PrivateCloud.md) Clouds. Some of the most important tasks that are managed by *Connected Portal* are:

- Creating [Subscriptions](Subscription.md)
- Creating [Instances](Instance.md)
- [Deploying](../Deployment/Repositories.md) [Microservices](../Microservices/README.md)
- Manage Billing
- Manage [Repositories](../Deployment/Repositories.md)
- Publish Support Tickets

To access *Connected Portal* you need a valid *Connected* User Account. You can create a one if you visit [SignUp](https://connected.tompit.com/signup) web page. 

Once you have a valid account, you can start using *Connected Portal*. You can access the portal if you visit its [Home Page](https://connected.tompit.com/subscription). If you have access to more that one [Subscription](Subscription.md) you can choose which one to manage by selecting it on the left pane.
