# Public Cloud

*Connected* is a cloud based platform which means it must execute in an special environment in order to work as expected. Cloud environment provides essential features needed for providing quality services to end users. 

*Connected* offers Cloud Services through the **Partner Network** which consists of a certified Cloud Providers. It's your decision in which Cloud you want to run your [Environment](README.md) if you decide to go with the Public Cloud route. We strongly recommend to do so because Cloud is a complex infrastructure that must be actively managed which is related to the relative high costs if you decide to run your Environment in a yours, Private Cloud.

All Public Clouds in *Connected* share the same set of properties:

- Fault tolerance
- High availability
- Scaling
- Hot swapping
- Internal networks for fast data exchange

All Clouds are managed and controlled via [Connected Portal](ConnectedPortal.md). This is also true for [Private Clouds](PrivateCloud.md) which means *Connected* guarantees a consistent experience regardless of the infrastructure.
