# Microservices


## Naming Microservices

### Models
Always append **.Model** [Models](../Microservices/Model.md) to the name of the [Microservice](../Microservices/README.md) so when referencing the user can quickly separate [Models](../Microservices/Model.md) from other type of [Microservices](../Microservices/README.md). For example:

```
TomPIT.Core.Model
```
