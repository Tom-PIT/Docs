# Getting Started

*Connected* is a platform for creating [Digital Content](../Environment/DigitalContent.md). *Digital Content* is organized into [Microservices](../Microservices/README.md). [Microservice] can provide features for [Service Layer](../ServiceLayer/README.md) or [User Layer](../UserLayer/README.md).

*Connected* ensures that all *Digital Content* is build with an unified architecture and guarantees a consistent experience for all users and across all devices.

Digital Content is stored in a cloud based [Code Management System](../Deployment/Repositories.md) from where it is [Deployed](../Deployment/README.md) to the [Instances](../Environment/Instance.md).
